fookebox is a jukebox-style web-frontend to mpd.

It offers the following jukebox features:

* Browse your music library by artist or genre
* Add songs to the playlist (obviously)
* Limit the queue size (see note below)
* Add whole albums to the playlist (optional)
* Remove songs from the playlist (optional)
* Search for artists/albums/titles/files (optional)
* Control mpd (optional)

In addition to that, fookebox has a second frontend intended for a projector
showing the currently playing song as well as the first queue entry. Also, in
case you are organizing an event where you only want to use the jukebox between
other events (live bands, DJs) fookebox can be told so and display that
information on the secondary frontend (details: see below).


== What you need ==

In order to run fookebox you will need:

* mpd
* some web server (eg. apache)
* php (should work with version 4 and 5)


== How to set it up ==

=== php.ini ===

Make sure to enable always_populate_raw_post_data in your php configuration or
fookebox will complain.

=== fookebox ===

Rename site.conf.php-dist to site.conf.php (in /config) and set it up
according to your needs (make sure to set base_url correctly, the rest is
optional - see below).

Also, make sure that your webserver can write to the skins/compiled directory.


== Detailed setup ==

All your fookebox configuration is done site.conf.php. You can tweak the
following settings:

* mpd_host: The hostname of the machine running mpd (eg. localhost)
* mpd_port: The port mpd is running on (6600 by default)
* mpd_pass: The password required to access mpd (or NULL if none)
* base_url: The URL to your fookebox installation
* skin: Your fookebox skin (currently only 'default' exists)
* max_queue_length: The maximum queue length. It's important to note that
  while fookebox does check that value, people who click fast enough might be
  able to bypass that check. Make sure to set your mpd's max_playlist_length
  accordingly (note that mpd's count includes the song which is being played
  so if you want 3 queue positions, set max_playlist_length to 4).
* show_search_tab: Whether you want the 'search' tab to be displayed
  (you might want to disable this on jukebox machines without a keyboard)
* enable_controls: Enables/disables mpd control elements (disable this on
  public jukebox installations)
* enable_song_removal: Whether users are allowed to remove songs from the
  queue (again, bad idea on public jukeboxes)
* enable_queue_album: Enables/disables the ability to queue full albums by
  clicking on the album name (might be a bad idea on public jukeboxes)
* find_over_search: Whether you want to use mpd's 'find' or 'search' function
  when an artist/genre/album has been clicked. The difference is that 'find'
  only returns exact matches while 'search' also matches substrings
  (eg. if you click on 'Air', 'find' will only return songs by 'Air' while
  'search' will also include 'Air feat. Joe Random' and 'Fair play')
