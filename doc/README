fookebox is a jukebox-style web-frontend to mpd.

It offers the following jukebox features:

 * Browse your music library by artist or genre
 * Add songs to the play list (obviously)
 * Limit the queue size (see note below)
 * Add whole albums to the play list (optional)
 * Remove songs from the play list (optional)
 * Search for artists/albums/titles/files (optional)
 * Control mpd (optional)

In addition to that, fookebox has a second frontend intended for a projector
showing the currently playing song as well as the first queue entry. Also, in
case you are organizing an event where you only want to use the jukebox between
other events (live bands, DJs) fookebox can be told so and display that
information on the secondary frontend (details: see below).


== What you need ==

In order to run fookebox you will need:

 * MPD
 * Some web server (eg. apache)
 * PHP5


== How to set it up ==

=== web server ===

Your web server needs to understand rewrite rules (for apache, enable
mod_rewrite).

Also, do not install fookebox under a userdir (eg. http://yourhost/~yourname)
since mod_rewrite will do bad things otherwise (see "Home directory expansion"
on http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_rewrite.html#rewriterule) and your
installation is going to break in subtle ways.

=== fookebox ===

Rename site.conf.php-dist to site.conf.php (in /config) and set it up
according to your needs (make sure to set base_url correctly, the rest is
optional - see below).

Also, make sure that your webserver can write to the skins/compiled directory.


== Detailed setup ==

All your fookebox configuration is done site.conf.php. You can tweak the
following settings:

 * mpd_host: The host name of the machine running mpd (eg. localhost)
 * mpd_port: The port mpd is running on (6600 by default)
 * mpd_pass: The password required to access mpd (or NULL if none)
 * base_url: The URL to your fookebox installation
 * site_name: A name for your site (eg. 'my home')
 * skin: Your fookebox skin (currently only 'default' exists)
 * max_queue_length: The maximum queue length (see below for details)
 * auto_queue: Whether to play random songs when the queue gets empty
 * show_search_tab: Enable/disable 'search' tab (eg. for mouse-only jukeboxes)
 * enable_controls: Enable/disable mpd control (disable on public jukeboxes)
 * enable_song_removal: Whether to allow the user to remove songs in the queue
 * enable_queue_album: Enables/disables the ability to queue whole albums
 * find_over_search: Whether to use mpd's 'find' or 'search' (see below)


== Secondary frontend ==

If you don't care about projectors and stuff, just ignore this section. It's
purely optional.

If you point your browser to yourfookeboxurl/program you will see fookebox'
secondary front end which is intended to be projected to a wall / shown on
a screen without user interaction. It will not only inform users about the
currently playing and the next song but in case you're using fookebox at some
kind of party, this front end will allow you to inform your users about any
other events that might be coming up (eg. a live band or a DJ).

An example of how to define such a program can be found in
config/status.conf.php which should be pretty self-explanatory.

== Additional notes ==

=== Queue length ===

It's important to note that while fookebox does try to enforce your mpd queue
length value, people who click fast enough might be able to bypass that check
so make sure to set your mpd's max_playlist_length accordingly (note that mpd's
count includes the song which is being played so if you want 3 queue positions,
set max_playlist_length to 4).

=== Cover art ===

Fookebox can display cover art for your music. In order to do that, set
album_cover_path in your site.conf.php to a directory that contains your
covers, named according to rockbox' album art file naming conventions
(see http://www.rockbox.org/wiki/AlbumArt for details).

Note that your covers need to be JPEG files and they will get scaled to
a width of 100 pixels.

=== Find or search? ===

When an artist/genre/album has been clicked, you can decide whether we tell mpd
to 'find' that item or to 'search' for it. The difference is that 'find' only
returns exact matches while 'search' also matches substrings (eg. if you click
on 'Air', 'find' will only return songs by 'Air' while 'search' will also
include 'Air feat. Joe Random' and 'Fair play').
